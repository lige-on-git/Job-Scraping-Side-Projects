# Job-Scraping-Side-Projects
Simple side projects to practice web scraping and its connection with a database. Eventually in the main job matching project, I plan to automate job scraping from some main-stream job searching websites; maintain one relational and one non-relational databases to store pre-processed and raw data; provide back end API for teammates to do job matching modelling.
